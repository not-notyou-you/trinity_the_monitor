"""
Shared dedup-key constants for `nasa_scenes` rows.

The unique key is (source, tile_id, product_short_name, acquisition_date).
etl/live_cycle.py (live ingest) and module9_fusion.py (fusion build) must
both use these exact values, or they silently create duplicate/orphaned
rows for the same underlying scene instead of reusing one.
